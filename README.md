# Linear Regression Health-cost-calculator


This project implements regression models to predict health insurance costs based on individual attributes like age, sex, BMI, smoker status, and region. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the application of various regression techniques such as linear, polynomial, ridge, and lasso regression. Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to assess model performance, with results visualized through scatter plots comparing predicted versus actual expenses.
